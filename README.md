The project uses a raspberry pi to control three hobby gearmotors using L293D controllers and PWM output from the raspberry pi. A full technical document will be written as part of the course and uploaded to this repository for anyone seeking to try out this project themselves. The arm, for the purposes of our project, will strike keyboard keys to type out messages.
